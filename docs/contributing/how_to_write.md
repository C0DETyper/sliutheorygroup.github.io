# How to Write

__Author__: Denan LI

This wiki is built on `MkDocs` + `read the docs theme` + `GitHub pages`.

## 1. Markdown

The wiki is written in `Markdown`, which is an `easy-to-read` and `easy-to-use` language.

Document written by Markdown can be easily exported to `HTML`, `PDF`, `png`, and other formats.

The suffix of Markdown document is `.md` or `.markdown`.

A very quick tutorial of Markdown: <https://www.runoob.com/markdown/md-tutorial.html>

We also provide a template Markdown file.

## 2. Editor（编辑器）

We strongly recommend using `Visual Studio Code (vscode)` as your editor.

## 3. Tips

* Please save the images and other asset files into the `docs/asset/WHERE_YOU_WANT` folder.
* When inserting the image, please use a relative path, for example: `![Fork Repo](../asset/contributing_how_to_contribute/forking.png)`
